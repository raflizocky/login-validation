The login validation project enhances security by creating a login form using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This form allows users to enter their email and password, which is then validated against predefined criteria or stored user data to ensure the authenticity and security of user login credentials.

If the entered email and password combination is correct, the user is granted access, and a successful login message is displayed. On the other hand, if the credentials are incorrect, an error message is shown, indicating that the email or password is invalid. This process prevents unauthorized access and provides a seamless and secure authentication process for users.
